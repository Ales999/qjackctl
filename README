JACK Audio Connection Kit - Qt GUI Interface
--------------------------------------------

Qjackctl is a simple Qt application to control the JACK sound server daemon
(http://jackit.sourceforge.net), for the Linux Audio Desktop infrastructure.

Written in C++ around the Qt3 toolkit for X11, most exclusively using Qt Designer.

Provides a simple GUI dialog for setting several JACK daemon parameters,
which are properly saved between sessions, and a way control of the status
of the audio server daemon.

Installation
------------

The installation procedure follows the standard for source distributions:

    ./configure [--prefix=/usr/local]
    make

and optionally as root:

    make install

This procedure will end installing the following couple of files:

    ${prefix}/bin/qjackctl
    ${prefix}/share/icons/qjackctl.xpm

Just launch ${prefix}/bin/qjackctl and you're off (hopefully).


Configuration
-------------

Qjackctl holds its settings and configuration state per user, in a file
located as $HOME/.qt/qjackctlrc. Normally, there's no need to edit this
file, as it is recreated and rewritten everytime qjackctl is run.


Bugs
----

Plenty. After all is still alpha stage. To date, qjackctl has been tested
with JACK release 0.72.4 and beyond, on SuSE 8.1, Mandrake 9.1 and RedHat 9,
with a custom 2.4.21 kernel with low-latency, preemptible and capabilities
enabling patches.

It has been found that each case may have some issues regarding JACK running in
realtime mode. Please be sure to run a capable kernel and play with either
jackstart or jackd server paths, which shall be root suid anyway, for a better
realtime experience.

A notable case has been Planet CCRMA based Red Hat installations,
(http://ccrma-www.stanford.edu/planetccrma/software/), where until recently
jackstart has failed to initiate on a non root environment, in realtime mode.
The upgrade to the latest jack-audio-conection-kit package is therefore
highly recommended, as it probably includes already a Paul Davis'
(JACK's lead developer) patch that targets this specific issue.

This problem is now officially closed, since JACK 0.75.0 release.

Note:

It has been reported that in some systems qjackctl hangs pretty badly after
stopping and restarting the JACK audio daemon, without quitting the application.
That is, each qjackctl running instance may only start and stop JACK only once.
After that, one have to quit and run it back again. This situation only happens
in specific systems, although very deterministically.

If you experience this behaviour, or any other you find annoying, please report
it on the project's page (http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/qjackctl). Remember
to include a description of your system, namely libc, gcc and qt versions.


Acknowledgments
---------------

Qjackctl's user interface layout (and the whole idea for that matter)
was partially borrowed from Lawrie Abbott's jacko project
(http://members.iinet.net.au/~lawrieabbott/pub/jacko),
which was taken from wxWindow/Python into the Qt/C++ arena.

Since 2003-08-06, qjackctl has been included in the awesome Planet CCRMA
(http://ccrma-www.stanford.edu/planetccrma/software/) software collection.
Thanks a lot Fernando!

Enjoy.
