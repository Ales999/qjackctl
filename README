JACK Audio Connection Kit - Qt GUI Interface
--------------------------------------------

Qjackctl is a simple Qt application to control the JACK sound server daemon
(http://jackit.sourceforge.net), for the Linux Audio Desktop infrastructure.

Written in C++ around the Qt3 toolkit for X11, most exclusively using Qt Designer.

Provides a simple GUI dialog for setting several JACK daemon parameters,
which are properly saved between sessions, and a way control of the status
of the audio server daemon. With time, this primordial interface has become
richer by including a enhanced patchbay and connection control features.

Installation
------------

The installation procedure follows the standard for source distributions:

    ./configure [--prefix=/usr/local]
    make

and optionally as root:

    make install

This procedure will end installing the following couple of files:

    ${prefix}/bin/qjackctl
    ${prefix}/share/icons/qjackctl.xpm

Just launch ${prefix}/bin/qjackctl and you're off (hopefully).


Configuration
-------------

Qjackctl holds its settings and configuration state per user, in a file
located as $HOME/.qt/qjackctlrc. Normally, there's no need to edit this
file, as it is recreated and rewritten everytime qjackctl is run.


Bugs
----

Plenty. After all is still alpha stage. To date, qjackctl has been tested
with JACK release 0.80.0 and beyond, on SuSE 8.1, Mandrake 9.1 and RedHat 9,
with a custom 2.4.22 kernel with low-latency, preemptible and capabilities
enabling patches.

One misfeature that still bugs some users who runs qjackctl and watches for
the messages output window is that stdout/stderr capture from JACK daemon
seems to be somewhat broken. The evident behaviour is that stdout only shows
up on server shutdown, while stderr is captured and shown unbuffered as
expected. This issue has been closed with latest JACK 0.90.x release.

Note:

It has been reported that in some systems qjackctl hangs pretty badly after
stopping and restarting the JACK audio daemon, without quitting the application.
That is, each qjackctl running instance may start and stop JACK only once.
After that, one might have to quit and run it back again. This situation only
happens in specific systems, although very deterministically.

If you experience this behaviour, or any other you find annoying, please report
it on the project's page (http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/qjackctl). Remember
to include a description of your system, namely glibc, gcc and qt versions.


Acknowledgments
---------------

Qjackctl's user interface layout (and the whole idea for that matter)
was partially borrowed from Lawrie Abbott's jacko project
(http://members.iinet.net.au/~lawrieabbott/pub/jacko),
which was taken from wxWindow/Python into the Qt/C++ arena.

Since 2003-08-06, qjackctl has been included in the awesome Planet CCRMA
(http://ccrma-www.stanford.edu/planetccrma/software/) software collection.
