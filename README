JACK Audio Connection Kit - Qt GUI Interface
--------------------------------------------

Qjackctl is a simple Qt application to control the JACK sound server daemon
(http://jackit.sourceforge.net), for the Linux Audio Desktop infrastructure.

Written in C++ around the Qt3 toolkit for X11, most exclusively using Qt Designer.

Provides a simple GUI dialog for setting several JACK daemon parameters,
which are properly saved between sessions, and a way control of the status
of the audio server daemon. With time, this primordial interface has become
richer by including a enhanced patchbay and connection control features.

Installation
------------

The installation procedure follows the standard for source distributions:

    ./configure [--prefix=/usr/local]
    make

and optionally as root:

    make install

This procedure will end installing the following couple of files:

    ${prefix}/bin/qjackctl
    ${prefix}/share/icons/qjackctl.xpm

Just launch ${prefix}/bin/qjackctl and you're off (hopefully).


Configuration
-------------

Qjackctl holds its settings and configuration state per user, in a file
located as $HOME/.qt/qjackctlrc. Normally, there's no need to edit this
file, as it is recreated and rewritten everytime qjackctl is run.


Bugs
----

Probably plenty still, but qjackctl it's now considered on beta stage already.
It has been locally tested since JACK release 0.94.0, on SuSE 9.0, Mandrake 10.0
and Fedora Core 1, with custom 2.4 kernels with low-latency, preemptible and
capabilities enabling patches. As for 2.6 kernels, the capabilities patch may
also apply but the emergence of the Realtime Linux Security Module (LSM) it's
being now recommended for your taking benefit of the realtime and low-latency
audio pleasure JACK can give.


Support
-------

Qjackctl is open source free software. For bug reports, feature
requests, discussion forums, mailling lists, or any other matter related
to the development of this piece of software, please use the
Sourceforge project page (http://sourceforge.net/projects/qjackctl).


Acknowledgments
---------------

Qjackctl's user interface layout (and the whole idea for that matter)
was partially borrowed from Lawrie Abbott's jacko project
(http://members.iinet.net.au/~lawrieabbott/jacko.html), which
was taken from wxWindow/Python into the Qt/C++ arena.

Since 2003-08-06, qjackctl has been included in the awesome Planet CCRMA
(http://ccrma-www.stanford.edu/planetccrma/software/) software collection.
