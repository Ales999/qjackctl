JACK Audio Connection Kit - Qt GUI Interface
--------------------------------------------

Qjackctl is a simple Qt application to control the JACK sound server daemon
(http://jackit.sourceforge.net), for the Linux Audio Desktop infrastructure.

Written in C++ around the Qt3 toolkit for X11, most exclusively using Qt Designer.

Provides a simple GUI dialog for setting several JACK daemon parameters,
which are properly saved between sessions, and a way control of the status
of the audio server daemon.

Installation Notes
------------------

The installation procedure follows the standard for source distributions:

    ./configure [--prefix=/usr/local]
    make

and optionally as root:

    make install

This procedure will end installing the following couple of files:

    ${prefix}/bin/qjackctl
    ${prefix}/share/icons/qjackctl.xpm

Just launch ${prefix}/bin/qjackctl and you're off (hopefully).


Configuration
-------------

Qjackctl holds its settings and configuration state per user, in a file
located as $HOME/.qt/qjackctlrc. Normally, there's no need to edit this
file, as it is recreated and rewritten everytime qjackctl is run.


Bugs
----

Plenty. After all is still alpha stage. To date, qjackctl has been tested
with JACK release 0.72.4 and beyond, on SuSE 8.1, Mandrake 9.1 and RedHat 9,
with a custom 2.4.21 kernel with low-latency, preemptible and capabilities
enabling patches.

It has been found that each case may have some issues regarding JACK running in
realtime mode. Please be sure to run a capable kernel and play with either
jackstart or jackd server paths, which shall be root suid anyway, for a better
realtime experience.

A notable case has been Planet CCRMA based Red Hat installations,
(http://ccrma-www.stanford.edu/planetccrma/software/), where until recently
jackstart has failed to initiate on a non root environment, in realtime mode.
The upgrade to the latest jack-audio-conection-kit package is therefore
highly recommended, as it probably includes already a Paul Davis'
(JACK's lead developer) patch that targets this specific issue.

This problem is now officially closed, since JACK 0.75.0 release.


Acknowledgments
---------------

Qjackctl's user interface layout (and the whole idea for that matter)
was partially borrowed from Lawrie Abbott's jacko project
(http://members.iinet.net.au/~lawrieabbott/pub/jacko),
which was taken from wxWindow/Python into the Qt/C++ arena.

Since 2003-08-06, qjackctl has been included in the awesome Planet CCRMA
(http://ccrma-www.stanford.edu/planetccrma/software/) software collection.
Thanks a lot Fernando!

Enjoy.
