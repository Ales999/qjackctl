JACK Audio Connection Kit - Qt GUI Interface
--------------------------------------------

TODOs

0.0.5 Backlog

- Make available some translations, as some has been contributed already;
  I'm missing "volunteers" for French (fr), German (de) and Spanish (es).
  
0.0.4 Backlog:

- Devise someway to make patchbay connections persistent, in a profile/preset
  manner, that will get automagically setup when respective JACK clients are
  detected on runtime; this will be handy por non-LADCCA aware clients.

0.0.3 Backlog:

- Display of current jackd version string.
- XRUN ticker visual charting.
- Any other feature one can think of ;)
