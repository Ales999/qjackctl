JACK Audio Connection Kit - Qt GUI Interface
--------------------------------------------

TODOs

0.1.1 Backlog

- Support for some or all of the newest jackd command line options
  (e.g. --inchannels, --outchannels and --shorts).
- Having some LADCCA support or awareness may be very welcome.


0.0.5 Backlog

- Make available some translations, as some has been contributed already;
  I'm missing "volunteers" for French (fr), German (de) and Spanish (es).


0.0.3 Backlog:

- Display of current jackd version string.
- XRUN ticker visual charting.
- Any other feature one can think of ;)
