JACK Audio Connection Kit - Qt GUI Interface
--------------------------------------------

TODOs

0.0.5 Backlog

- Change the startup mess of forcing artsd and jackd itself, as seen
  on options and upgrade to a more generic start/stop script model;
  this way, one can also include the operation of the LADCCA daemon.
  (this was nicely suggested on a followup with Kasper Souren).
  
- Make available some translations, as some has been contributed already;
  I'm missing "volunteers" for French (fr), German (de) and Spanish (es).
  
0.0.4 Backlog:

- Devise someway to make patchbay connections persistent, in a profile/preset
  manner, that will get automagically setup when respective jack clients are
  detected on runtime; this will be handy por non-LADCCA aware clients.

0.0.3 Backlog:

- Display of current jackd version string.
- XRUN ticker visual charting.
- Any other feature one can think of ;)
