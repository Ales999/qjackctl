JACK Audio Connection Kit - Qt GUI Interface
--------------------------------------------

ChangeLog

0.0.5   2003-09-04  Work in progress.

- Internationalization support added; future qjackctl_${LANG}.qm translation
  files are located on ${prefix}/share/locale .

- New dummy and portaudio driver support (as of jack release 0.80.0+).

0.0.4   2003-08-29  Minor changes and bugfixes.

- The patchbay port lists are now sorted in a more numerical friendly manner
  (as suggested by Steve Harris); the sort code has been "borrowed" from
  qjackconnect, yet again.

- Patchbay port connection lines are now always visible, even if their
  respective connected port items aren't.

- Multiple simultaneous port connections can now be handled when a client
  application item is selected for connection/disconnection (again, suggested
  by Steve Harris), replicating and extending qjackconnect's similar behaviour.

- An auto-refresh option for the patchbay connections is now available,
  for those cases when client code just can't handle properly some callbacks.

- Window positioning and sizing is now almost persistent across sessions;
  as before, position is saved for the minimal view mode; but now, the details
  dialog view mode gets its position and size independantly saved also.

0.0.3   2003-08-07  Integrated visual patchbay.

- A patchbay for jack port connections is now integrated, much like the
  greatest Mathias Nagorni's qjackconnect (http://www.suse.de/~mana/jack.html).

0.0.2   2003-08-02  Client code features introduced.

- JACK library and header files are checked on configure.
- Server CPU load, sample rate and time elapsed since last XRUN
  detected, are now displayed on statistics.
  
0.0.1   2003-07-26  Initial release.
