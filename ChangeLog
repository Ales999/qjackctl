JACK Audio Connection Kit - Qt GUI Interface
--------------------------------------------

ChangeLog

0.0.9   2003-09-25  Work in progress.

- New connection port item pixmaps that distinguishes physical from
  logical ports;
  
- History of most recently used values gets saved for some settings
  and options comboboxes widgets.

- New startup and shutdown script options, intended to supersede the
  mess of forcing artsd and jackd itself, in a near future ;) this way,
  one can also include the operation of the LADCCA daemon (following a
  suggestion from Kasper Souren).

- Connections command buttons are now shortly disabled after clicking,
  avoiding accidental duplicated connections.
  

0.0.8   2003-09-19  Preliminary transport and buffer size status control.

- Transport status and control introduced (requires JACK 0.80.0+);

- Statistics tab renamed to Status, where the transport state info and
  simple play/pause control buttons are now placed;

- Buffer size status is yet another item on the list view.


0.0.7   2003-09-15  Minor bugfixes.

- Inverse alphabetic ordering fixed on Connections port listing.

- Verbose option added; messages view font size fix; about Qt dialog;
  logo pixmap retouched.

- Configure script now checks for Qt 3.1.1 or greater.


0.0.6   2003-09-12  Drag-n-drop and more feature enhancements and bufixes.

- Patchbay connection user interface handling has been fairly rewritten;
  (features new bugs while fixing old ones ;-)

- Reset XRUN statistics button added; reset time recorded on statistics;
  calculated latency is now shown on settings; ASIO mode disables
  Periods/Buffer setting (all suggestions by Lawrie Abbott).

- Context popup menu introduced for port connection handling; includes
  new command for disconnecting all currently connected ports.

- Closing the application while JACK is running, is now presented with a
  warning confirmation message (preventing accidental Esc key press? :).

- Patchbay port lists ordering are now more numerical-friendly than ever,
  taking account for sub-numbering port names (following yet another
  suggestion from Lawrie).

- Connection drag-and-drop is now featured after many, many requests.

- Corrected the configure script to properly recognize Qt 3.0.1 or greater.


0.0.5   2003-09-05  Minor feature enhancements and bugfixes.

- Internationalization support added; future qjackctl_${LANG}.qm translation
  files are located on ${prefix}/share/locale .

- New dummy and portaudio driver support (as of JACK release 0.80.0+).

- A couple of silent memory leak bugs have been corrected.


0.0.4   2003-08-29  Minor changes and bugfixes.

- The patchbay port lists are now sorted in a more numerical friendly manner
  (as suggested by Steve Harris); the sort code has been "borrowed" from
  qjackconnect, yet again.

- Patchbay port connection lines are now always visible, even if their
  respective connected port items aren't.

- Multiple simultaneous port connections can now be handled when a client
  application item is selected for connection/disconnection (again, suggested
  by Steve Harris), replicating and extending qjackconnect's similar behaviour.

- An auto-refresh option for the patchbay connections is now available,
  for those cases when client code just can't handle properly some callbacks.

- Window positioning and sizing is now almost persistent across sessions;
  as before, position is saved for the minimal view mode; but now, the details
  dialog view mode gets its position and size independantly saved also.


0.0.3   2003-08-07  Integrated visual patchbay.

- A patchbay for jack port connections is now integrated, much like the
  greatest Mathias Nagorni's qjackconnect (http://www.suse.de/~mana/jack.html).


0.0.2   2003-08-02  Client code features introduced.

- JACK library and header files are checked on configure.
- Server CPU load, sample rate and time elapsed since last XRUN
  detected, are now displayed on statistics.
  
  
0.0.1   2003-07-26  Initial release.
